it's used, and how it works as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit in Python.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **What is Tkinter?**\n","\n","- **Tkinter** is Python’s standard library for building desktop GUI applications.\n","- It is a thin object-oriented layer over the **Tcl/Tk** GUI toolkit.\n","- Tkinter is **cross-platform** – meaning the same code can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n","- It is **built-in** with Python, so you don’t need to install anything separately.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Why Use Tkinter?**\n","\n","- Simple and beginner-friendly.\n","- Quick to develop GUI prototypes.\n","- Wide support and resources.\n","- Excellent for small to medium desktop applications.\n","- Lightweight compared to other frameworks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **How Tkinter Works – The Core Concepts**\n","\n","#### 1. **Importing Tkinter:**\n","You typically import Tkinter using this convention:\n","\n","```python\n","import tkinter as tk\n","```\n","\n","This avoids polluting the global namespace and keeps your code clean.\n","\n","#### 2. **Creating the Main Application Window:**\n","This is the root of your application where all widgets will be placed.\n","\n","```python\n","root = tk.Tk()\n","```\n","\n","#### 3. **Setting the Window Title and Size:**\n","\n","```python\n","root.title(\"My Application\")\n","root.geometry(\"400x300\")  # width x height\n","```\n","\n","#### 4. **Running the Application Loop:**\n","\n","```python\n","root.mainloop()\n","```\n","\n","This **event loop** keeps your window open, waiting for user interaction.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Full Example: Your First Tkinter Window**\n","\n","```python\n","import tkinter as tk\n","\n","root = tk.Tk()                        # Create main window\n","root.title(\"Hello Tkinter\")          # Set title\n","root.geometry(\"300x200\")             # Set window size (width x height)\n","\n","root.mainloop()                      # Start the event loop\n","```\n","\n","#### What Happens Here:\n","- A blank window appears with a size of 300x200 pixels.\n","- The title of the window is set to \"Hello Tkinter\".\n","- The application waits until the user closes it (via `mainloop()`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary:**\n","- Tkinter is Python's built-in library for GUI development.\n","- GUI apps begin with a root window created using `tk.Tk()`.\n","- The app stays open using `mainloop()` which handles events like clicks, typing, and window management.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Mini Practice Task:**\n","Write a Python script that:\n","- Creates a window with title **\"Welcome Window\"**\n","- Sets the size to **500x300**\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tNSckrvfTVA1"},"source":["## **Lesson
